Texture segmentation and recognition is an important task in image processing. In this repository, Law's texture filter is implemented to calculate the multi-dimensional feature vector for a given image. Four types of Law's texture filters are supported, these filter sizes are 3 x 3, 4 of 5 x 5, 5 of 5 x 5 and 7 of 7 x 7. In addition, the Law's texture filter and energy maps outputs are available. The feature vector is a multi-dimensional normalized feature vector of energy maps.
